        <p>Marvel’s Black Panther is set for release on Feb. 16, and it’s already on track to be the biggest, Blackest movie of the year. The first ever Black-led superhero movie for the studio has already got people talking, and we’ve seen some pretty epic trailers released as we gear up for February.

        T’Challa, who first appeared in Captain America: Civil War, inherited the throne during that movie’s events when his father, King T’Chaka, was killed. Now, in Black Panther, T’Challa, played by Chadwick Boseman, returns to his homeland to claim that throne and all of the responsibility that it entails. After all, Wakanda is the most technologically advanced country in the world, and they guard their secrets fiercely.
        “He has to keep harmony between the tribes within his country, and that means managing expectations and doing things that are unpopular,” director Ryan Coogler explained, according to BlackMovie.com. “At the same time, he is the protector of that nation.”</p>

        <div class="header text-center">PREPARE FOR BLACK PANTHER WITH MARVEL’S FREE SAMPLER COMIC</div>
        <p>Next month, Marvel is set to unleash the first Black Panther movie, and the company has already lined up a soundtrack curated by Kendrick Lamar as well as Hasbro toys inspired by the film. The Black Panther’s upcoming cinematic adventure is distillation of several decades of comic book stories, and Marvel doesn’t want fans to forget that. As part of a plan to draw in new readers, Marvel is going to give away a free Black Panther comic starting at the end this month.

Via Marvel.com, the Black Panther — Start Here one-shot will be available in comic book stores on Wednesday, January 31. Essentially, its a free sampler that features excerpts from the current volume of Black Panther by writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and artist Brian Stelfreeze, as well as a previous Black Panther run by Reginald Hudlin and John Romita Jr., and the spinoff series, World of Wakanda.

Additionally, the one-shot will have a few pages from Black Panther and the Crew, a spinoff by  Coates and artist Butch Guice that unites Black Panther with Storm, Luke Cage, and Misty Knight.

This release shows Marvel appears to be serious about getting non-comic readers and lapsed fans into stores to check out the Black Panther‘s ongoing series and spinoffs. Frankly, it’s a great idea that should have been implemented years ago, but better late than never.

        <div class="header text-center">Black Panther "Good to be King"</div>
        <p>Chadwick Boseman, who plays the titular Black Panther in Marvel’s upcoming super hero movie, takes a look at his character’s ascension to king and his newfound responsibilities in “Good to Be King,” a new, action-packed video featurette from Marvel Studios:condimentum. These featurettes give you just enough to make you want to know more. Of course, for that you’ll have to see the movie, buy the DVD, watch all the special features and track down those elusive press interviews.

It appears Disney’s marketing machine has been doing a fantastic job promoting “Black Panther” as the pre-sale tickets are setting record numbers for a solo super hero film. If that demand translate into opening weekend sales, then Ryan Coogler’s film might just be Marvel’s biggest blockbuster yet. Purchase your tickets ahead of time via Fandango to make sure you have a seat. (A portion of your ticket will help support The Disney Blog. Thank you.)

About the film:
Marvel Studios’ “Black Panther” follows T’Challa who, after the death of his father, the King of Wakanda, returns home to the isolated, technologically advanced African nation to succeed to the throne and take his rightful place as king. But when a powerful old enemy reappears, T’Challa’s mettle as king—and Black Panther—is tested when he is drawn into a formidable conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people and their way of life.

“Black Panther” stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, with Angela Bassett, with Forest Whitaker, and Andy Serkis.</p>

        <p>We are one month out from the domestic theatrical release of Walt Disney's Black Panther. Okay, fine, technically we're less than one month out if you count Thursday previews, but cut me some "my kids got up really early on MLK Day" slack. Official pre-release tracking probably won't drop until a week from Thursday (three weeks out seems to be the norm), but all signs point to enough anticipation that the only real danger is overinflating expectations so that an $85 million-$95 million debut looks disappointing. Granted, I could easily see the Chadwick Boseman-starring action thriller challenging Deadpool for the biggest solo and biggest non-sequel superhero debut of all time ($132m Fri-Sun/$152m Fri-Mon on the same weekend in 2016, natch), but we'll cross that bridge when the time comes.

Assuming the Ryan Coogler-directed film is A) at least pretty good and B) does at least pretty well (I would define "pretty well" as Thor: The Dark World-level business, or Ant-Man-level depending on the budget and post-debut legs), it's going to be seen as a watershed moment in pop culture. Audiences of all stripes flocked to what seems to be an Afrofuturistic sci-fi spectacular with a majority black cast in numbers equal to or even better than a similar project featuring the standard "mostly white guys" cast. Like Wonder Woman, it will be a generational event for targeted demographics, and it will offer proof that minority-specific blockbusters can do every bit as well as those with more conventional casting approaches.</p>
